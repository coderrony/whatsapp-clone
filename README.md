# socket.io
This project is based on the Udemy course "Build a WhatsApp Clone with Video Calls â€“ MERN Stack & Socket.IO", which I have successfully completed.

Before taking this course, I was planning to build a betting application but realized I lacked a solid understanding of WebSockets. This course helped me gain practical knowledge of real-time communication using Socket.IO and also covered:
- WebRTC for peer-to-peer video calling
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication
- Authentication & Authorization flows
- Full-stack development using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)
- Essential real-time app concepts

This course significantly improved my understanding of real-time applications and gave me the confidence to work on more complex projects involving sockets and live interactions.

ðŸ‘‰ I encourage you to check out my [betting application repository](https://tailwin) where Iâ€™ve applied the knowledge gained from this course to build a real-world project.
